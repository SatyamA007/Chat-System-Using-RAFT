# Chat-System-Using-RAFT
CS271 Winter 2022 Final Project

In this final project, we will develop a distributed highly available chat system replicated on a set of clients. The clients are responsible for maintaining a log of encrypted messages using Raft. Clients will be able to join and leave group chats and only clients within a group will have access to the messages of that group.
